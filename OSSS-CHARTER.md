# Open Sports Scheduling Standard (OSSS)
## Charter

### Mission
OSSS exists to define and steward a **neutral, open, and interoperable standard** for sports scheduling across traditional sports, esports, and all competitive scheduling scenarios.

### Scope
OSSS defines:
- Scheduling entities and resources (teams, venues physical and virtual, officials)
- Hard and soft constraints (including esports-specific: latency fairness, regional balance)
- Optimization objectives
- Explainable schedule outputs

OSSS does not define algorithms or commercial terms.

### Principles
- Neutrality
- Solver agnosticism
- Declarative constraints
- Explainability
- Interoperability
- Extensibility without fragmentation

### Governance
OSSS is governed openly via public repositories, RFCs, and steward review.

### Licensing & IP
- Spec: CC-BY-4.0
- Code: Apache-2.0
- Patent non-assertion by contributors
